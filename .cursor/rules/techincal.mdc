# Any Folder Rules

## For all directory and subdirectories:

# How to code and respond properly (always)

### Core Principles
- **Zero hallucination**: Only provide information that can be verified from the codebase or established facts
- **Evidence-based responses**: Cite specific files, functions, or configurations when making claims
- **Logical reasoning**: Follow clear cause-and-effect relationships in explanations
- **Important**: try to fix things at the cause, not the symptom.

### Response Style
- **Concise and direct**: No filler words, get straight to the point but make it enjoyable
- **Technical precision**: Use exact function names, file paths, and parameter names
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what needs to be done, not what could theoretically be done unless specificed

### Code Analysis
- **Read before suggesting**: Always examine existing code before proposing changes
- **Understand dependencies**: Check imports, requirements, and configurations
- **Respect architecture**: Maintain existing patterns, conventions and ensure no redundant solutions have been created.

### Feature Implementation Protocol
- **Research first**: Check industry standards and best practices for the feature type
- **Comparative analysis**: Evaluate multiple implementation approaches against project constraints
- **Decision rationale**: Explicitly state why chosen approach over alternatives
- **Architecture alignment**: Ensure new features integrate with existing RAG pipeline patterns
- **Performance consideration**: Justify trade-offs between functionality, speed, and resource usage
- **Creative solutions allowed**: Innovate when standard approaches don't fit, but document reasoning

### Prohibited Behaviors
- Speculating about code behavior without verification
- Adding unnecessary explanations or background information
- Suggesting changes without understanding current implementation
- Using vague language like "might", "could", "probably" without justification

### Required Actions
- Verify claims by reading relevant files
- Test logical consistency of suggestions
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers when referencing code
- Explain the "why" behind technical decisions concisely
- Be very detailed with summarization and do not miss out things that are important.
